    "GLOSSARY": "WORDS   MEANING     Acute Angle   An angle whose measure is less than 90 degrees.     Adjacent Angles   Two angles that share a ray, thereby being directly next to each other.     Algorithm   An organ ised procedure for performing a given type of calculation or solving a given type of problem.  An example is long division.     Alternate Exterior Angles   Angles located outside a set of parallel lines and on opposite sides of the transversal.     Alternate Interior Angles   Angles located inside a set of parallel lines and on opposite sides of the transversal.     Angle Bisector   A ray that divides an angle into two congruent angles.     Arithmetic  Mean   See mean.     Arithmetic S equence   A sequence of elements, a 1, a2, a3,\u2026.., such that the difference of successive terms is a constant a i+1  - ai = k; for example, the sequence {2, 5, 8, 11, 14, \u2026 } where the common difference is 3.     Associative Property   This property applies both to multiplication and addition and states that you can group several numbers that are being added or multiplied (not both) in any way and yield the same value.  In mathematical terms, for all real numbers a, b, and c, (a+b)+c=a+(b+c) or (ab)c=a(bc).     Asymptotes   Straight lines that have the property of becoming and staying arbitrarily close to the cur ve as the distance from the origin increases to infinity.  For example, the x -axis is the only asymptote to the graph of sin (x)/x.     Bar Graph   A diagram showing a system of connections or interrelations between two or more things by using bars.     Base Depth of the Triangular Prism   The perpendicular distance from the base of the triangle to the top of the triangle.     Base of Triangular Prism   The triangular end of the prism.

Class Interval   In plotting a histogram, one starts by dividing the range of all values into non -overlapping intervals, called cla ss intervals, in  such a way that every piece of data is contained in some class interval.     Coefficients   The constant multiplicative factor of a mathematical object.  Objects include variables, vectors, functions, matrices etc. For example, in the expression: 4d+52t+3s, the 4, 5, and 3 are coefficients for the variables d, t2, and s respectively.

The operations of addition (+) and multiplication (x) are commutative on the set of real numbers.  This property means that you can rearrange the order of the object  being added or reorder numbers being multiplied without changing the value of the expression.

Coordinates of a point are determined by the distance of this point from the lines, and the signs of the coordinates are determined by w hether the point is in the positive or in the negative direction from the origin.     36  WORDS   MEANING     Coordinates   A unique ordered pair of numbers that identifies a point on the coordinate plane.
